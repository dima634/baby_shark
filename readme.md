### TODO:
- [ ] StlWriter - calculate normal from vertices (now iterator over face vertices are executed twice)
- [ ] CornerTable/Remesher - preallocate estimated amount of elements for internal arrays
- [ ] Reusable vectors across app to reduce allocations for iter macro
- [ ] Do we need to save next corner index? 
- [ ] Corner table: handle edge boundary collapse
- [ ] Corner table: better index typing
